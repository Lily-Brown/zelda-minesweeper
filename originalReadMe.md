The Practical Part
==================
Hi Lily, it was a pleasure meeting you yesterday! This will be the last part of the interview (we promise)!

Details
-------
This portion of the interview will allow us to see your design/technical thought process and skills in more detail. You are allowed to use any technology/framework that you are most comfortable with. 

Requirements
------------
Create a fully functioning [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game. You can use this [algorithm] (http://kitedeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/04/minesweeper-using-recursion-to-reveal.html) so that you can focus on the design and feel of the game. Feel free to use the assets provided or use your own. The necessary components:
* Allow the user to set the size (# of rows and columns) before the game starts
* Allow the user to set a difficulty level (e.g. easy = 5% of the cells are bombs, medium = 25%, and hard = 50%)
* Include a README that explains all the features that you implemented as well as any instructions to get your application running.
 
Besides these requirements, you are allowed to create and design any additional features you see fit.

Extra Credit
------------
* Implement a backend feature and create a leader board based on time.

Deadline
--------
You will have until Wednesday, March 29, 2017 at 11:59 PM PST to submit your final commit.
